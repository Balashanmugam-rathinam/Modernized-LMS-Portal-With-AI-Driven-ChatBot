## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser.
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Installation

1. *Clone the repository* (or download the files).
2. *Configure API Key*:
   Open services/geminiService.ts and replace process.env.API_KEY with your actual key, or ensure your build environment injects it.
   typescript
   const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY';
   
3. *Run the Application*:
   Since this project uses ES Modules and importmap, you can serve the root directory using any static file server.
   
   Using Python:
   bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   Using Node (http-server):
   bash
   npx http-server .
   

4. *Access*: Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
